### [Shot 1: Title] Raphael

"Welcome to our presentation on GPT-5: Transforming Software Development."

"In the fast-paced world of software engineering, developers are constantly looking for tools that offer intelligence, adaptability, and efficiency. GPT-5 represents a transformative leap in AI-assisted development, empowering teams to build smarter, faster, and more securely."

### [Shot 2: Introduction] Divjot

"GPT-5 was introduced in August 2025 and brings tremendous potential to software development. It supports secure, ethical, and interdisciplinary development, making it an ideal choice for teams aiming to create scalable and innovative software solutions."

"With GPT-5, developers can analyze information, solve complex problems, write essays, generate code, and assist with both creative and technical tasks—all through natural, conversational language."

### [Shot 3: Examples of GPT-5 in Action] Kai

"Let’s look at some real-world examples."

"Cursor AI, if you haven't heard of it, basically it is a coding AI inside the IDE, like VSCode."

Recently, Cursor AI started running GPT-5, showing that they believe GPT-5 can significantly improve coding.

### [Shot 4: Benefits for Developers] Kai

"GPT5 brings a lot of benefits when it comes to coding

"GPT5 can generate code in a second, helps devs debug and test, reducing development time."

"GPT 5 handles repetitive tasks, while devs can focus on logic and higher level design"

"It can handle big projects and complex tasks from different areas thanks to its intelligence"

" Making an app requires multiple tools, but ChatGPT-5 came in clutch (come in handy): it can use multiple tools and manage complex workflows.”

### [Shot 5: Challenges and Risks] Arun

"Despite its advantages, there are challenges and risks."

"Skill and accuracy risks: over-reliance on GPT-5 may erode problem-solving abilities, and the model can produce inaccurate or misleading outputs, especially in complex scenarios."

"Ethical and oversight challenges: deploying GPT-5 in sensitive domains raises concerns about bias, accountability, and transparency, making careful human review essential."

### [Shot 6: Future Outlook] Divjot

"Looking ahead, GPT-5 is changing the role of developers."

"From coder to architect: as GPT-5 automates routine coding, developers will focus more on system design, architecture, and strategic planning."

"AI pair programming: developers will collaborate with GPT-5 as a virtual teammate, using it for ideation, prototyping, and debugging, while retaining control over critical decisions."

"Faster learning curve: GPT-5 helps developers quickly grasp new languages, frameworks, and APIs through examples and explanations."

"Expanded productivity: with GPT-5 handling documentation, testing, and code translation, developers can focus on innovation and user experience."

"And ethical oversight: developers will play a critical role in validating AI-generated code, ensuring security, compliance, and fairness in AI-powered systems."

### [Shot 7: Closing] Raphael

"In conclusion, GPT-5 is a transformative tool in software development, empowering developers to work smarter, faster, and more securely, while shaping the future of AI-assisted programming."

“Here is a question for yall.. The question is “Is it ethical for companies to hire AI instead of interns when human learning is at stake?””
"Thank you for watching."
